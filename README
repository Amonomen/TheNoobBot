To do :

FailOver auth server : Working solution, but we can't afford another server.

Send informations to servers about the items looted every 55 seconds. (every statistic pulse)
ItemId mostly and maybe a basic ItemType as well.

Work on as much questing profiles as possible. Priority over Draenor.

Implement Battle Pet system.

Implement DungeonBot. (either just solo farm old dungeon or tag and follow the tank in random dungeon queue)
