TheNoobBot is a software that intend to reproduce real players movements in the World of Warcraft environment.

The bot do uses Injection of ASM for Click To Move, Interact, Lua Executions.
The bot do read the WoW memory by retrieving the offsets addresses of the usefuls value from the executable file.

TheNoobBot project have been public since 17 february 2013, for the WoW version 4.3.3 and the project is still active as of expansion Mists of Pandaria.


Importants things to do for 5.4.0 support:

Find a solution to the new DBC system, SpellDBC can be temp-fixed by using a LUA + internal caching (list), but DBC like LockDBC will cause troubles.
There should be a way to keep reading DBC like before, they are maybe just encrypted, or cached in another part of the memory.


Ideas to realizes

Make sure the FailOver auth server is working well, and merge the Mesh server on it so we can get separated from the Mesh server (useless cost).

Implement a loot tracking system, that will be able to provide statistic on the collections of a defined ItemId or GameObjectId,
can provides "all time, last 24h, last 48h, last week, last month, last year" informations, with graphs.

Implement/Test the Melee Control Manager system (currently on stand-by).

Implement/Test the InteractWithBeta functions that will allow us to interact with an Unit/Object without walking to it.
