The bot do read the WoW memory by retrieving the offsets addresses of the usefuls value from the executable file.

TheNoobBot project have been public since 17 february 2013, for the WoW version 4.3.3 and the project is still active as of expansion Mists of Pandaria.


Importants things to do for 5.4.0 support:

Find a solution to the new DBC system, SpellDBC and SpellMiscDBC have changed their way of being read to get informations like "SpellName InGame" (client lang) can be temp-fixed by using a LUA + internal caching (list), others DBC seems not affected.
There should be a way to keep reading DBC like before, they are maybe just encrypted, we can analyze how LUA reads them the first time to get them.
They are possbility now server-side, like items names, and will be cached in WDA files after they got read once, will allow more maniability from Blizzard servers.
It still possible to extract the DBC from the MPQ though... (But wont work as we need to fit client language)


Ideas to realizes

Make sure the FailOver auth server is working well, and merge the Mesh server on it so we can get separated from the Mesh server (useless cost).

Implement a loot tracking system, that will be able to provide statistic on the collections of a defined ItemId or GameObjectId,
can provides "all time, last 24h, last 48h, last week, last month, last year" informations, with graphs.

Implement/Test the Melee Control Manager system (currently on stand-by).

Implement/Test the InteractWithBeta functions that will allow us to interact with an Unit/Object without walking to it.

Implement/Test the QuickSpellUsableLUA (never commited yet) functions that will allow us to cast more spell, faster.
